# -Experimental_Laboratory_Analyses_and_Practical_Work_Reports
This repository contains all my experimental laboratory analyses and the associated practical work reports. This includes the LaTeX and MATLAB codes used for its production
The totality of the work reports, the final products, are in the work reports folder. 
For each experimental analysis (TP), all data are collected in each TP file in a .xls or .txt in lab and in a .mat file once converted.
Moreover, its following LaTeX code (main_tex) used to do the work report and MATLAB to make the graphs (Code_et_Donn√©es_matlab/code_graphe_TP..) are also available in each TP file.
